# Exponential growth

Exponential growth is how the increase in the number of people infected in an epidemic is often described. This means the number of people infected is not increasing linearly, as we saw with percentages, instead the numbers multiply - that is they double, and then double again, and again, and so on.  So for example if two people are infected on the first day, there will be four infected people the next, and then 8, then 16 and so on. In practice the Covid-19 virus does not spread quite this fast, but doublings of infections in a week to two weeks have been observed.

If there is nothing to stop exponential growth the numbers involved are mind boggling. A famous example of this is the *wheat and chessboard problem", which is supposedly the payment asked by the inventor of the game of chess from his monarch. The payment requested was one grain of wheat in the first square of the chess board, two in the next, then four, and so on.  These seem like tiny quantities, but there are 64 square on the chess board, and the numbers grow so rapidly that eventually the quantity of wheat would need to be measured in billions of tonnes, far more in fact than there is wheat in the world.

## Exponential growth presents us with a number of problems

### How can we properly describe it so others can understand?  

Hopefully the description above made sense, so what if the time to double keeps changing, or the numbers grow very large, how can we explain to others what is happening?

### How can we calculate exponential growth?

We don't really want to have to multiply numbers over and over again to calculate the number of people likely to be infected, so we need to have mathematical techniques to calculate the number of infections over time.

### Why do the number of infections increase in this way?

Percentages (or ratios) seem like a good way of calculating numbers of people infected, so why can't we use them to estimate the number of people who will be infected in future?
